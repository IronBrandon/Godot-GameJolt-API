A simple GameJolt API plugin for Godot 4.\
The same GameJolt API used in IrÃ¸nBrandon's [Home Grown](https://ironbrandon.itch.io/homegrown) (_beta and full release_).

Forked from Deakcor's [GameJolt API plugin](https://github.com/deakcor/-godot-gj-api)

## Introduction

### Features

- Verbose mode with detailed comments
- Full offline code documentation in the form of Godot's custom docs
- Code regions to easily review the plugin's code
- Refactored to fit with Godot 4(_.3_)+

### Installation

1. Click "Code" and then "Download ZIP".
2. Drag and drop the "Godot-GameJolt-API" folder into your project's addons folder.
    - You do not need the files '.gitattributes' or 'README.md'. All the other files are required.
3. Rename the plugin's folder from "Godot-GameJolt-API" to "gamejolt_api" to follow Godot's naming conventions.
4. Next, go to **Project > Project Settings... > Plugins** and enable the "GameJolt API" plugin.
5. Lastly save your project and click **Project > Reload Current Project**.

And it's installed!

## **How To Use**
_this section is incomplete_

To add the GameJoltAPI node, select "Add Child Node" and add the GameJoltAPI to your main scene or
under an Autoload scene (_if you have multiple scenes_).
- You should only have one GameJoltAPI node per game.

Next, set the export variables `Private Key` and `Game ID` to your game's private key and game ID.

Now you can call GameJoltAPI methods through a parent node or an extended script!

### Authenticate User

If your game is going to be distributed as a Web build, you can execute the method `user_auto_auth()`
which will retrieve the player's username and token via the URL.\
When debugging, add _`?gjapi_username=<username>&gjapi_token=<token>`_ to the URL (_replace
\<username\> and \<token\> with your username and token_).

However, if you're distributing it as a program (_or want a manual option_), you can instead use
`user_auth(username, token)` to authenticate the user. Just create a simple "log-in" menu and
have the player enter their username and token.

Next, you can connect the `gamejolt_request_completed` signal to a node. Do this either through the
editor or the code. Here is some example code:

```gdscript
# In the below example, the GameJoltAPI node is a child of this node.

var user_authenticated: bool = false

@onready var gamejolt_api: GameJoltAPI = get_node("GameJoltAPI")
@onready var username_box: LineEdit = get_node("username_box")
@onready var token_box: LineEdit = get_node("token_box")
@onready var login_button: Button = get_node("login_button")

func _ready(): # Connect the signals to the methods in ready.
    login_button.pressed.connect(_on_login_pressed)
    gamejolt_api.gamejolt_request_completed.connect(_on_gamejolt_request_completed)

func _on_login_pressed():
    gamejolt_api.auth_user(username_box.text, token_box.text)
    login_button.disabled = true

func _on_gamejolt_request_completed(request_type, response):
    match request_type:
        '/users/auth/':
            user_authenticated = response['success']
            if user_authenticated:
                pass # Add code for when the user is authenticated.
            else:
                pass # Add code for when the user fails to authenticate.
            login_button.disabled = false
        # Use a match statement so you can add more request_types later
```
